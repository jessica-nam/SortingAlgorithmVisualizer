# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer

## Description

This project is a simple sorting algorithm visualizer. It generates a random list of values from 0 - 100 and sorts them using the bubble sort and insertion sort algorithm implemented in Python
Upon running this code, a pygame window will pop up with a bar graph of the random values and options to choose which sorting algorithm to implement.

- My motivation for this project
- I built this visualizer to familarize myself with how sorting algorithms work and this program allows me to see the algorithm in action. I plan to expand on this project by implementing other algorithms such as heap sort, selection sort, etc.

## Installation

1. To use this program, first clone the repository --> https://github.com/jessica-nam/SortingAlgorithmVisualizer.git into any editor

2. Make sure python is installed --> python --version
    If python is not installed --> https://www.python.org/
    
3. Check for pip installation --> pip --version
    If pip is not installed --> python get-pip.py
    
4. Install PyGame --> pip install pygame

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
